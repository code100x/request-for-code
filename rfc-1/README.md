Create a simple Bitcoin like server that has the following components -

1. Central server - A central websocket server that all miners connect to to exchange messages
2. Miner server -

- Code that miners can run to be able to create blocks, do proof of work, broadcast the block via the central server.
- Code that verifies the signature, balances and creates / adds a block
- Code should reject smaller blockchains/erronours blocks
- Should be able to catch up to the blockchain when the server starts

3. Frontend -

- Lets the user create a BTC wallet
- Lets the user sign a txn, send it over to one of the miner servers

Tech stack - Preferably Node.js/Golang for the servers

## Bounties

1. Simple Servers without UTXOs (in memory balances) - $200
2. UTXOs for ins and outs - $200 (for point 1) + $200
